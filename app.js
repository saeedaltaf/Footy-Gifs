//Pseudo Code
//Create an array of footy gif topics
//Create a button for each gif topic
//Use a for loop to append a button to each string in the array
//Grab 10 static, non-animated GIFS from GIPHY API
//They should animate on click (play/pause)
//Display rating of each GIF under the GIF
//Make AJAX call that takes each topic in array and remakes the buttons on the page
